# Identity and positionality

Traditional science training may lead us to believe that it is possible to analyse and interpret data truly objectively, but realistically our lived experiences are likely to influence the ways we do our research. 
This could be 'macro' influences like our motivations to address a particular problem, or 'micro' like the way we numerically represent a social attribute. 
Whilst there are lots of benefits to the indivdiual ways we all think and experience the world, these ways of thinking we develop can embed unseen biases into the way we think and work. 
The understanding of our identities, socio-cultural position and philosophical approach to knowledge in the context of our research is called our *positionality*.
We can understand our positionality through the process of *reflexivity*. 

**Reflexivity**: An act of self-reflection that considers how oneâ€™s own opinions, values, and actions shape how data is generated, analysed and interpreted. (https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199599868.001.0001/acref-9780199599868-e-1530)

It is particuarly common in qualitative work that reflexivity is part of the process of analysing data but this is not usually the case in quantitative work, and especially data science. 
However, becoming more aware of our potential biases in data science, and particuarly machine learning and AI, may help us to more quickly see where and how bias is being embedded in our systems so that we can act on it. It may also make us aware of changes that need to take place in our local environments to make our research environments more inclusive, that we can then champion through {ref}`Activism<er-activism>`.

## Epistemology and Ontology



## Understanding ourselves and our context

You could use the Social GRACES [Ref Burnham - borrowed from social work] to think about different aspects of your identity, and how they overlap. 

The GRACES are a mnemonic to help cover aspects of identity that affect our power and privilege. - they are not fixed and you can choose the most relevant ones, or add more. Over time the GRACES have developed and more letters have been added - use what ever helps! 
    - G = Gender, Geography
    - R = Race, Religion
    - A = Age, Ability, Appearance
    - C = Class, Culture
    - E = Ethnicity, Education, Employment
    - S = Sexuality, Sexual Orientation, Spirituality
