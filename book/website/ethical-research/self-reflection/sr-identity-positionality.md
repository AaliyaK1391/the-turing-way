# Identity and positionality

Traditional science training may lead us to believe that it is possible to analyse and interpret data truly objectively, but realistically our lived experiences provide the lenses through which we see the world, which are known as our *epistemologies*. 
Our epistemologies then go on to influence the ways we do our research. 
This could be 'macro' influences like our motivations to address a particular problem, or 'micro' like the way we numerically represent a social attribute. 
Whilst there are lots of benefits to the indivdiual ways we all think and experience the world, these ways of thinking we develop can also embed unseen biases into the way we think and work. 
The understanding of our identities, socio-cultural position and epistemological approach to knowledge in the context of our research is called our *positionality*.
We can understand our positionality through the practice of *reflexivity*, which is the process of using *self-reflection* to better understand how our positionality influences the way we behave in our work. 

It is particuarly common for reflexivity to be part of the process of analysing data in qualitative work, but this is not usually the case in quantitative work like data science.
However, becoming more aware of our potential biases in data science, and particuarly machine learning and AI, may help us to more quickly see where and how bias is being embedded in our systems so that we can act on it. 
It may also make us aware of changes that we need to make, or fight for to make our research environments more inclusive (see {ref}`Activism<er-activism>`).

## Power and privilege

Our identities and positions are tightly interwoven with themes of power and privilege that accompany our experiences of class, race, and gender. 



 Note - just because you have power/privilege in one way, does not mean you are powerful in all ways - _both/and_ rather than _either/or_. 
Intersectionality 



## Understanding ourselves

You could use the Social GRACES to think about different aspects of your identity, and how they overlap. 

The GRACES are a mnemonic to help cover aspects of identity that affect our power and privilege. - they are not fixed and you can choose the most relevant ones, or add more. Over time the GRACES have developed and more letters have been added - use what ever helps! 
    - G = Gender, Geography
    - R = Race, Religion
    - A = Age, Ability, Appearance
    - C = Class, Culture
    - E = Ethnicity, Education, Employment
    - S = Sexuality, Sexual Orientation, Spirituality
