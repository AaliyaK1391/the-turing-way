# Identity and positionality

Traditional science training may lead us to believe that it is possible to analyse and interpret data truly objectively, but realistically our lived experiences provide the lenses through which we see the world, and influence the way we behave, including how we do research.
This could be 'macro' influences like our motivations to address a particular problem, or 'micro' like the way we numerically represent a social concept. 
Whilst there are lots of benefits to the individual ways we all experience the world, these ways of thinking we develop can also embed unseen biases into how we think and work. 
For example, we might choose training data for a model without thinking to consider whether it is representative in a particular way, or we might not consider whether a data visualisation is accessible to people with color blindness. 
Our unseen biases could also impact the way we frame our research questions.
By better understanding ourselves we can be more proactive about spotting where we might hold biases or gaps in our knowledge. 
This means we can be transparent about how our unique view has influenced the way we work, which is beneficial to scientific integrity and reproducibility. 
It can also help us to identify and work against systemic and structural barriers that might otherwise go unchallenged.

It is particuarly common for reflexivity to be part of the process of analysing data in qualitative work, but this is not usually the case in quantitative work such as data science.
This tends to be because data science, and data as a whole, is often seen as being inherently neutral. 
However, we know now that the way data is collected, recorded and used can create significant problems for fairness, accountability and bias in data science systems. 
Becoming more aware of our potential biases in data science, and particuarly machine learning, may help us to more quickly see where and how bias is being embedded in our systems so that we can act on it. 
It may also make us aware of changes that we need to make to make our research environments more inclusive (see {ref}`Activism<er-activism>`).

The placement of our identities, socio-cultural position and epistemological approach to knowledge in the context of our research is called our *positionality*.
We can understand our positionality through the practice of *reflexivity*, which is the process of using *self-reflection* to better understand how our identities and experiences influence the way we behave in our work.

## Power and privilege

When thinking about positionality, it is important to understand how we might hold power or priviledge relative to the people we work with, those whose data we are studying, or the problems we are attempting to solve. 
Our identities are tightly interwoven with themes of power and privilege that accompany our experiences of class, race, and gender and more {cite:ps}`crenshaw1989demarginalizing, collins1990black`. Themes of power and privilege are present in all of our contexts, even if they are not immediately obvious. 

To illustrate, here are some examples of how power and privilege present as structural issues in data science:  
<!-- Welcome more examples here! -->
- Racial injustice and patriarchial systems have meant that data science has historically been dominated by White men. This means that there has not been a diverse group of people to direct the aims of data science work, and so many groups are likely to be overlooked when considering the negative impacts of data science, and also the potential benefits. 
- The English language is the default in many programming languages and academic settings, which creates barries to knowledge sharing and inclusion. Rather than English speakers learning other languages, it is generally expected that non-English speakers learn English in order to participate and collaborate, which frames English as the default. 
- Data science work can require huge amounts of energy and computational power, which disproportionality affects the lives of people living in the places most affected by climate change. These countries tend to already be economically disadvantaged relative to others, and have less access to the resources needed to manage the impacts of climate change. 

### Intersectionality 

The term **intersectionality** refers to how multiple identities can intersect, and so people can be oppressed because of combinations of their identities instead of their seperate identities. The term was coined by Kimberlie Crenshaw in 1989 {cite:ps}`crenshaw1989demarginalizing` to describe the way that laws that protected Black people and women did not protect against discrimination that exclusively affected Black women. 
Now, the term 'intersectionality' has become more widely used and broadly refers to how people are often disadvantaged by multiple sources of oppression. 

Intersectionality has sometimes incorrectly been asssumed to be a way of making a 'heirarchy of oppression', which is not its purpose. We must recognise that power and privilege is a case of _both/and_ rather than _either/or_. 
This means that someone may be privileged in one way, and disadvantaged in another.

## Understanding ourselves

Self-reflection and reflexivity can be challenging, and take time and practice to feel natural.
To be most effective they should be employed throughout our work, and will never be 'finished', because we change and so does the world around us. 
In order to help get started there are lots of frameworks which can be used as a guide.
One of these is called the 'Social Graces' which was developed by psychotherapists John Burnham, Alison Roper-Hall and colleagues in the 1990s {cite:ps}`burnham2018developments`.

The Social Graces are a mnemonic to help cover aspects of identity that affect our power and privilege.
They are not fixed and you can choose the most relevant ones, or add more.
The idea of the Social Graces was to explicitly name power differentials, which might be visible or invisible in our interactions. 

- **G** = Gender, Geography
- **R** = Race, Religion
- **A** = Age, Ability, Appearance
- **C** = Class, Culture
- **E** = Ethnicity, Education, Employment
- **S** = Sexuality, Sexual Orientation, Spirituality

The Graces are a helpful place to start thinking about your intersecting identities.
It can also be helpful to ask:
- Which of the social GRACES do I particuarly identify with? Are there some that stood out to me right away?
- Which GRACES did not stand out to me, and why might that be?
