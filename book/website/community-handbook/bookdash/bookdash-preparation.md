# Selection and Preparation Process

This subchapter explains the process of selection and logistics for organising the book dash.

## Selection of the book dash participants

The designated selection panel meets after they have individually scored the applications using the rubrics defined in the previous subchapter.
They agree upon a final set of up to 15 participants selected to participate in the book dash.
The panel members also create constructive feedback on the application that can be shared with the applicants who were not selected so that they can assess other pathways to engage with the project and core team.

All applicants are contacted at least 6 weeks in advance to ensure that they can assess their situation and availability for the book dash.

Upon confirmation, they are provided with registration details through which they can share any information that can help them and the organisers prepare for the book dash.
Participants are asked to get familiarised with [_The Turing Way_ GitHub repository](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) where they will make their contributions during the book dash.
The project's [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and {ref}`Code of Conduct<ch-coc>` are also shared with the participants that are applicable to the book dash as well.

To further support the participants, pre-event calls are hosted and further details are shared directly by email (discussed in the next subchapter).

The names of the selected participants are announced in _The Turing Way_ newsletter and social media platforms upon agreement with the participants.
