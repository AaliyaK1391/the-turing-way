# Fireside Chat Series

*The Turing Way* Fireside Chat is a series of public seminar/webinar like events that feature experts, champions and their projects in reproducibility, open research, ethics, collaboration and opportunities in data science and research.

*The Turing Way* team collaborates with different international communities to co-design and co-host Fireside informal discussions on topics of shared interests. 
Speakers are invited from diverse backgrounds and perspectives to present their views, contextualise the topics in their areas of work and catalyse cross-community collaboration through knowledge sharing.

## Background

Different stakeholders in open research have a shared mission of making scientific knowledge freely available for public access. 
However, most of these communities operate independently of other initiatives, either lacking the capacity to build meaningful collaboration or competing for limited resources. 
This often results in scientific outputs that most users can find, but not access, or build upon in their local contexts.

In *The Turing Way*, we believe that cross-community collaborations are crucial for exchanging resources and experiences that can contribute to individual progress as well as the overall sustainability of the open science ecosystem. (Sharan, M. (2021). Can we reimagine FAIR for building communities in open science? Zenodo. DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5518163)
With the Fireside Chat series, we aim to enable discussions that are of broader interest and can enable cross-community interactions and exchanges.

## Scope

Fireside Chat series has so far hosted events online on topics of interest within *The Turing Way* community as well as members across other mission-aligned projects such as The Carpentries, Open Post Academics, Open Science Community in Saudi Arabia, Wikimedia and Talarify in South Africa and MetaDocencia.
We will continue to collaborate with other communities working in participatory, open research and citizen space to organise future events on topics that they are working on.

Although, *The Turing Way* hosts these calls in English, we encourage our collaborative projects to consider hosting a future event in their time zones, in their primary languages and on topics relevant to their local contexts.

### Themes

Titles of past events include "Project, Community, Reproducible Research: What Exactly is The Turing Way?", "Shared Concerns in Open Research Communities", "Gaps and opportunities for multilingual data science" and "Emergent Roles in Research Infrastructure & Technology".

Suggestions of topics for the future Fireside chat include:
1) Hidden labour in open source: How are we changing volunteer culture?
3) Planning sustainability for our grassroots projects
4) Cross-community resource exchange: learning from citizen spaces

### Frequency and Duration

These calls are hosted every month on the third or fourth Friday as per the common availability of all speakers.
Recommended duration is 60 to 90 minutes that are recorded to post online for people who can't attend these calls in real-time.
Hosts can consider allocating a part of the call for open discussions with participants, however, this part doesn't need to be recorded to allow maximum participation by attendees who may otherwise not engage.
The schedule is decided based on the availability of individuals invited as speakers/panellists.

### Resources
 
- **Eventbrite pages**: Registrations are handled via [*The Turing Way* Eventbrite page](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/o/the-turing-way-18600928389). The event is free to attend and recordings are shared with all registered participants after the event.
- **Zoom**: We host Fireside events online using [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) (with live transcription), however, the platform for the participants can change based on the preference of the majority of speakers.
- **Online promotion**: Announcements are shared on *The Turing Way* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/turingway), [Slack workspace](https://tinyurl.com/jointuringwayslack) and [monthly newsletters](https://tinyletter.com/TuringWay), which are then cross-posted by other communities in their network.
- **Shared Documents**: We currently use Etherpad by Software Freedom Conservancy to enable shared note-taking during the event. See this for example - https://pad.sfconservancy.org/p/ttw-fireside-chat-mar2022. 
    - **Template** is provided as a subchapter: {ref}`ch-template-fireside-chat`.
    - **Archived notes** are currently shared via HackMD: https://hackmd.io/@turingway/fireside-chats.
- **Video Recording**: Video recordings with closed captioning are shared on *The Turing Way* YouTube channel in the [Fireside Chat video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuNA3Qa8A-k&list=PLBxcQEfGu3DmBcSmt9GVfo4wN1KP1y2yl).

### Participants

- **Hosts**: Two co-hosts, one from The Turing Way team and one from the collaborating project drive the planning and designing of the event, as well as co-chairing the event. 
- **Speakers**: 3-4 speakers are invited from multiple communities to allow multiple perspectives to be shared. Speakers are invited several weeks before the event to contribute to the event at the planning phase by sharing questions they hope to discuss during the event.
- **Open participation**: To enable open collaboration during the event, we facilitate open collaboration via Zoom chat and shared note-taking. Although the event is an informal discussion, we record the session upon speakers' permission. We do not run interactive sessions to avoid recording anyone who may not have consented to be recorded. Call hosts can plan to allocate part of the event for open discussions that should not be recorded.
 
*The Turing Way* Code of Conduct applies to the Fireside Chat participants and all interactions taking place as a part of the event.
