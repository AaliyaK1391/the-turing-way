# Sharing your data through a Data Article
A Data Article is a publication that is focused on the description of a dataset. It makes use of the traditional journal article structure, but focuses on the data collection and methodological aspects and generally not on the interpretation or discussion of the results.

##  Motivations For Sharing Data through a Data Article

Data articles are in line with the {ref}`FAIR principles<rr-rdm-fair>`, especially since most publishers will encourage you to share the data through a data repository. The benefit of a Data Article is that your output will be {ref}`peer reviewed<cm-peer-review>`, something which is generally not the case for datasets that are archived on {ref}`data repositories<rr-rdm-sharing>`. It also facilitates recognition for datasets through research assessment procedures that are more traditionally focused on publication output.
