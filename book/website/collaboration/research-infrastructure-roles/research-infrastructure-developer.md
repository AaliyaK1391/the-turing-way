# Research Infrastructure Developer: Overview

Research Infrastructure Developers (RIDs) are experts in building and maintaining the customised hardware and software infrastructure used by researchers, ranging from the very large (High Performance Computing systems and data storage services) used by thousands of users down to bespoke virtual machines for individual projects.  They are highly skilled team members who can also conduct their own research as part of their role.

## What do Research Infrastructure Developers do? 

Research Infrastructure Developers design and build the computational and data infrastructure for researchers, making use of best practice techniques such as software defined infrastructure, continuous integration and deployment, version control) to create systems that are performant, resiliant and easy to (re-)deploy and maintain.

They may be attached to a specific project or they may work as part of a team building and supporting larger, shared services (most usually both).

Because the role involves design responsibility for future infrastructure, RIDs may be PIs or have their own research projects related to infrastructure (for example looking at a new accelerator, network or processor technology), depending on the institution and policies of the projects they are working on.

<!-- IMPORTANT!

- Use this template to create your chapter's subchapters.
- Refrain from writing very long subchapters as readers may be unwilling to read them. Rather, you should split long subchapters into smaller subchapters if necessary.



BEFORE YOU GO
