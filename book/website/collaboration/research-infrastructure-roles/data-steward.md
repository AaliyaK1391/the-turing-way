# Data Stewards: Overview

Data Stewards are a growing role within scientific communities.
'Data Steward' is an umbrella term for numerous support roles that involve the creation, management and usage of research data (see also the {ref}`rr-rdm` chapter). 
The core responsibilities of a Data Steward can vary, ranging from policy advisor/consultant, to hands-on operational tasks, to technical or ICT-related tasks. 
A Data Steward faciltates the quality, integrity and access to (meta)data in a manner that is consistent with the appropriate laws and institutional policies, ensuring professional treatment of data throughout all stages of the research project.

## What do Data Stewards do? 

> **Talk about your key idea in detail**. Feel free to use images, code blocks, and admonitions to communicate your ideas.
> You may break the section down into subsections if you wish, however, remember to add [labels](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-crossref.html) to any additional headers you create to facilitate cross-referencing.

> Remember to use the [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style.html) and Jupyter Book's [Cheat Sheet](https://jupyterbook.org/reference/cheatsheet.html) to guide your writing.
> The [style guide](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/style/style-citing.html) also contains _The Turing Way's_ recommendations for referencing and citation.

> To include an image in your writing, use the MyST directive shown below. 
> Remember to add your image to the `figures` [folder](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/tree/main/book/website/figures) and use the correct path, else it will not be displayed.

```{figure} ../../figures/image-name.png
---
name: image-name
alt: describe your image for readers who rely on screen readers
---

```

> To include code blocks, simply enclose your code in three sets of backticks shown below.

```
def simple_function():
    pass
```

> To include an admonition or to highlight a block of text that exists slightly apart from the narrative of your section, use the directive shown below. Jupyter Book's [documentation](https://jupyterbook.org/content/content-blocks.html#) has other useful examples.

```{note}
Here is a note!

## Summary

> **Add a short summary of this subchapter with key takeaways.**
> You may also recommend and link to other chapters/subchapters you want your readers to explore after reading this subchapter.


<!-- IMPORTANT!

- Use this template to create your chapter's subchapters.
- Refrain from writing very long subchapters as readers may be unwilling to read them. Rather, you should split long subchapters into smaller subchapters if necessary.
