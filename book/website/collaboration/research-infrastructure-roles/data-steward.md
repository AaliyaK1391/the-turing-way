# Data Stewards: Overview

Data Stewards are a growing role within scientific communities.
'Data Steward' is an umbrella term for numerous support roles that involve the creation, management and usage of research data (see also the {ref}`rr-rdm` chapter). 
The core responsibilities of a Data Steward can vary, ranging from policy advisor/consultant, to hands-on operational tasks, to technical or ICT-related tasks. 
A Data Steward faciltates the quality, integrity and access to (meta)data in a manner that is consistent with the appropriate laws and institutional policies, ensuring professional treatment of data throughout all stages of the research project.

## What do Data Stewards do?

## Who are Data Stewards?



## What qualifications or skills do you need to be a Data Steward? 
There is currently no formal track to take to become a Data Steward. Most Data Stewards have a master or doctoral education, or a background in research and education. 
This background is needed to speak the same language as scientific staff, so that it becomes easier to understand their requirements and concerns. 
Pending on the particular focus of the position, you would need a more technical/ICT background, knowledge of discipline specific matters or experience with advising and policy construction. 
Soft skills are important in the advisory/policy roles, as you need to..

The “Towards FAIR data stewardship as profession” report (Scholtens, S., Jetten, M., Böhmer, J., Staiger, Ch., Slouwerhof, I., Van der Geest, M. & Van Gelder, C.W.G. (2019, October 3). Final report: Towards FAIR data steward as profession for the lifesciences. Report of a ZonMw funded collaborative approach built on existing expertise. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3474789) concluded that there are eight compentency areas that of importance to Data Stewards: 
1. policy/strategy
2. compliance
3. alignment with FAIR
4. services
5. infrastructure
6. knowledge management
7. network
8. data archiving

Generally, Data Stewards aquire these skills through learning-on-the-job, which is facilitated by existing networks (such as the [Research Data Alliance](https://www.rd-alliance.org/), and the [DTL-Data Stewards Interest Group](https://www.dtls.nl/about/community/interest-groups/data-stewards-interest-group/), and [Research Data Access & Preservation](https://rdapassociation.org/)) and sharing experiences with peers, learning discipline specific skills, joining community activities and personal/professional development. Examples of collaborative efforts are the '[23 Things: Support for Research Data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3465896)' that provides a good overview of helpful resources for Data Stewards and ... 
As the research culture adapts to (inter)national changes, so too have the skills of the Data Steward have to be continously updated.

## Challenges? 
Career-track unclear
Lack of awareness of policies or presence of the data steward
Part of cultural change towards more transparant research culture: cultural change is generally met with resistance
Institutional support: Often there is only a small team available for each instutite, which might not always cover the needs
