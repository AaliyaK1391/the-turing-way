# Data Stewards: Overview

Data Stewards are a growing role within scientific communities.
'Data Steward' is an umbrella term for numerous support roles that involve the creation, management and usage of research data (see also the {ref}`rr-rdm` chapter).

## What do Data Stewards do? 
The core responsibilities of a Data Steward can vary, ranging from policy advisor/consultant, to hands-on operational tasks, to technical or ICT-related tasks. 
A Data Steward facilitates the quality, integrity and access to (meta)data in a manner that is consistent with the appropriate laws and institutional policies, ensuring professional treatment of data throughout all stages of the research project.

## Who are Data Stewards?
Data Stewards are individuals with an interest in research data, and all the aspects that are related to this. 


## What qualifications or skills do you need to be a Data Steward? 
There is currently no formal track to take to become a Data Steward. Most Data Stewards have a master or doctoral education, or a background in research and education. 
This background is needed to speak the same language as scientific staff, so that it becomes easier to understand their requirements and concerns. 
Pending on the particular focus of the position, you would need a more technical/ICT background, knowledge of discipline specific matters or experience with advising and policy construction. 
Soft skills are important in the advisory/policy roles, as you need to..

The “Towards FAIR data stewardship as profession” report (Scholtens, S., Jetten, M., Böhmer, J., Staiger, Ch., Slouwerhof, I., Van der Geest, M. & Van Gelder, C.W.G. (2019, October 3). Final report: Towards FAIR data steward as profession for the lifesciences. Report of a ZonMw funded collaborative approach built on existing expertise. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3474789) concluded that there are eight competency areas that of importance to Data Stewards: 
1. Policy/strategy: designing or raising awareness of research data management policies and regulations
2. Compliance: advise on how to confer to research data management policies and regulations
3. Facilitating FAIR/recommended research data management practices
4. Services: propose, implement and monitor data management services and improve work processes
5. Data infrastructure: identify requirements for infrastructure and tools
6. Knowledge management: identify the level of research data management knowledge and skills
7. Network and communication: set up networks to increase awareness and participate in (inter)national research data management networks
8. Data sharing: archiving and publishing

Next to these specific areas coordination of work and development of soft skills may be important. 

Generally, Data Stewards acquire these skills through learning-on-the-job, which is facilitated by existing networks (see {ref}`cl-infrastructure-datastewards-support` below). 
Through these networks experiences can be exchanged with peers. 
Examples of collaborative efforts are the '[23 Things: Support for Research Data](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3465896)' that provides a good overview of helpful resources for Data Stewards and ... 
Depending on the role of the Data Steward, learning discipline specific skills may be iportant through contributing to specific projects or attending conferences/meetings on relevant topics. 
, joining community activities and personal/professional development. 

As the research culture adapts to (inter)national changes, so too have the skills of the Data Steward have to be continuously updated.

## Challenges for Data Stewards
* As Data Steward is a relatively new profession (~2017), their job profile is not always formally defined and their career-track may be unclear.
* It is difficult to increase the awareness of the presence of the data steward and/or existing data policies, especially when resources are limited.
* Not everyone sees the move towards a more transparent research culture as beneficial, and you can be met with resistance from researchers that do not want to change their existing workflows.
* There might be limited resources/time to cover all the support requests from researchers. 
Often there's only a small central team of Data Stewards available to the entire instutite. 
* It is not always clear when you're providing high quality support and where you could improve, as there is no formal education and there is not always a strong feedback culture at your institute. 

## Benefits of having Data Stewards
* Sharing recommended practices around data management so that researchers don't have to reinvent the wheel themselves
* Data Stewards can provide reassurance to researchers, by providing feedback on their Data Management Plans, practises and providing advise on alternative solutions
* Support for larger, collaborative grants where data management and open science are an integral part of the proposal (Horizon Europe)
