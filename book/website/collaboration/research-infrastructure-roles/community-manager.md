```{admonition} CSCCE Skills Wheel - Five Core Competancies 
The Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement have released a skills wheel showing the wide variety of different skills a scientific community manager might need to perform their roles. 
The five core competancies are: technical skills, communication, programme management, programme development and interpersonal. 
Every community manager role will need a different balance of these skills depending on the needs, aims and platforms of their community.
