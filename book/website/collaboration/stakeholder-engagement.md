# Facilitating Stakeholder Engagement

When working with stakeholders beyond your own team, there are many tools and best practices for improving the quality of engagement through activities like mapping relevant project stakeholders, organising effective stakeholder workshops, establishing shared language and understanding, and creating the foundation for effective collaboration.

This chapter will share guidance and resources for facilitating different forms of stakeholder engagement for data science collaborations drawing upon expertise from the Turing Research Application Management (RAM) team.

## Stakeholder mapping
### Key question: Who is involved in a collaboration, either as a user, impacted group, or as part of a project team?

The goal of stakeholder mapping is to centralise information on the people and organisations involved in a collaboration in one place. 
This helps establish a shared understanding of who is involved in what capacity, which is a useful resource for onboarding new teammates and to make sure everyone is on the same page.
This activity is also often a precursor to other engagement activities such as impact assessment and user experience workshop as it identifies who and which groups should be centered in the research process.
Stakeholder mapping is a core activity of many Research Infrastructure Roles and may serve different goals, for example:
- Research Community Managers may use this to establish a project governance structure and decide the most effective methods and channels for communication with each stakeholder group
- Research Application Managers may use this to categorise and prioritise different kinds of users of research outputs, such as local government or industry partners
- Research Project Managers may use this for project reporting and evaluation purposes and identifying whom to invite for a certain meeting

## Requirements gathering and alignment
### Key question: How can we align stakeholders on shared language and goals?

When bringing people from different backgrounds or organisations into a collaboration, it may be necessary to align on shared language and understanding on key concepts relevant to a project.
This is motivated by the fact that different teams may have different ways of working and understandings of project outputs like "case study" or "user-friendly website" which can lead to miscommunication or misalignment of expectations.
Requirements gathering is a helpful exercise to interview members of each team to collect information which can then be used to mitigate potential misunderstanding, map shared terminology, and identify opportunities for collaboration. 
Once the information is gathered in a single place, you can identify key questions and highlights from the interviews to prompt group discussion for alignment.

## Team strategy workshops
### Key question: How can we bring different ideas across the team into a shared team strategy?

## Running stakeholder workshops
### Key question: What work before, during, and after a workshop should be done to run an effective stakeholder workshop?

Workshops are perfect for those occasions where there is a need to bring people together to deeply engage on an area of interest with a view to working on a task which will facilitate towards achieving a goal. 

Organising an effective workshop is a multi stage process which can be segmented into 3 stages; pre-workshop, workshop execution and post-workshop. 

Pre-workshop: A workshop which runs according to

## User experience workshops
### Key question: How can a user-centric design process improve the usability of research outputs?
