# Facilitating Stakeholder Engagement

When working with stakeholders beyond your own team, there are many tools and best practices for improving the quality of engagement through activities like mapping relevant project stakeholders, organising effective stakeholder workshops, establishing shared language and understanding, and creating the foundation for effective collaboration.

This chapter will share guidance and resources for facilitating different forms of stakeholder engagement for data science collaborations drawing upon expertise from the Turing Research Application Manager (RAM) team.

## Stakeholder Mapping
### Key Question: Who is involved in a collaboration, either as a user, impacted group, or as part of the Community of Practice?

The goal of stakeholder mapping is to centralise information on the people and organisations involved in a collaboration in one place. 
This helps establish a shared understanding of who is involved in what capacity, which is a useful resource for onboarding new teammates and to make sure everyone is on the same page.
This activity is also often a precursor to other engagement activities such as impact assessment and user experience workshop as stakeholder maps can help identify who should be centered in the research process.
Stakeholder mapping is a core activity of many Research Infrastructure Roles and may serve different goals, for example:
- **Research Community Managers** may use this to establish a project governance structure and decide the most effective methods and channels for communication with each stakeholder
- **Research Application Managers** may use this to categorise and prioritise different kinds of users of research outputs, such as Local Government vs. Industry partners
- **Research Project managers** may use this for project reporting and evaluation and identifying who to invite for a meeting

### RAM insights
* Stakeholder mapping isn't meant to be a single source of truth - it is a tool to capture a team's understanding of the stakeholder landscape, clarify stakeholder relationships, and surface stakeholder groups that may share common characteristics or challenges. Whilst this resource may not provide specific solutions to successful stakeholder engagement, a well thought-out, detailed stakeholder map will help facilitate bringing a team onto the same page, which can help progress developing stakeholder engagement pipelines.
* We encourage teams to define their own metrics for mapping stakeholders on a matrix for prioritisation. These metrics should be carefully chosen to represent the key stakeholder considerations and project team goals. For example, are is the team trying to:
    * Establish a community of practice for project governance
    * Prioritise communication methods and cadence to different stakeholder groups
    * Identify which groups may be negatively impacted by a research output
    * Identify which stakeholders are most prepared to adopt a particular research output
  Choosing the right metrics will help crystallise the crucial stakeholders to engage.
    

## Requirements Gathering & Alignment
### Key Question: How can we align stakeholders on shared language and goals?

Requirements gathering is a helpful exercise used to collect information from different stakeholders involved in a project which can then be used to mitigate potential misunderstanding, map shared terminology, and identify opportunities for collaboration. 
When bringing people from different backgrounds or organisations into a collaboration, it can be helpful to align on shared language and understanding on key concepts relevant to a project.
This is motivated by the fact that different teams may have different ways of working and understandings of project outputs like "case study" or "user-friendly website" which can lead to miscommunication or misalignment of expectations.
Once the information is gathered in a single place, to support a group conversation, you can identify key questions and highlights from the interviews to prompt group discussion for alignment.

### Example Resources

### RAM insights
* Often times different people will use the same term to mean completely different things or for different purposes
* This exercise can help detangle the nuances of a commonly used term and whether or not there is overlap, and thus, opportunity to build shared understanding and goals
* Requirements gathering is informed by the user interview process from the design and qualitative research worlds
* The work begins after you gather requirements information, which is the starting point to facilitate a group conversation

## Team Strategy Workshops
### Key Question: How can we bring different ideas across the team into a shared team strategy?

A team will struggle to collaborate and progress together if its members are not aligned on what it is trying to achieve. 
Strategy alignment goes deeper than agreeing on day to day work - it asks what the team chooses to prioritise, what they value, what motivates them, and ultimately what real-world impact the hope to see from their work.
A helpful model to inform this exercise is Simon Sinek's [Golden Circle method](https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/online-value-proposition/start-with-why-creating-a-value-proposition-with-the-golden-circle-model/), where the team approaches their work in the following order:
* Why: Why are we doing what we're doing? 
    * This is the ultimate 'North Star' or 'vision' of the project - the fundamental, emotive reason the work is being done
* How: How do we achieve our mission? 
    * This question concerns the broad focus areas, or 'pillars' that setup up the project to achieve the vision
* What: What do we actually do?
    * This question takes the why and the how, and identifies key activities that teams can undertake to achieve their goals

It is important to take these conversations in order, so that team strategy and alignment can build from the bottom-up.

### RAM Insights
* Leading the conversation is fine! Providing a baseline structure helps focus minds and provide clarity. What you want is to provide the minimum infratstructure to allow people the space to express their minds.
* Our templates have been designed to focus massively on facilitation skills (reading the room, seeing patterns etc.). We feel this is an important approach as it allows open conversations to happen and things to emerge that otherwise might not in overly-structured environments.
* These are just one of many templates you may find useful, and only reflect our learnings as a team. Please amend/correct as you see fit, and share learnings with us!
