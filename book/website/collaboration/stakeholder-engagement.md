# Facilitating Stakeholder Engagement

When working with stakeholders beyond your own team, there are many tools and best practices for improving the quality of engagement through activities like mapping relevant project stakeholders, organising effective stakeholder workshops, establishing shared language and understanding, and creating the foundation for effective collaboration.

This chapter will share guidance and resources for facilitating different forms of stakeholder engagement for data science collaborations drawing upon expertise from the Turing Research Application Management (RAM) team.

## Stakeholder mapping
### Key question: Who is involved in a collaboration, either as a user, impacted group, or as part of the community of practice?

The goal of stakeholder mapping is to centralise information on the people and organisations involved in a collaboration in one place. 
This helps establish a shared understanding of who is involved in what capacity, which is a useful resource for onboarding new teammates and to make sure everyone is on the same page.
This activity is also often a precursor to other engagement activities such as impact assessment and user experience workshop as stakeholder maps can help identify who should be centered in the research process.
Stakeholder mapping is a core activity of many Research Infrastructure Roles and may serve different goals, for example:
- Research Community Managers may use this to establish a project governance structure and decide the most effective methods and channels for communication with each stakeholder
- Research Application Managers may use this to categorise and prioritise different kinds of users of research outputs, such as local government vs. industry partners
- Research project managers may use this for project reporting and evaluation purposes and identifying who to invite for a certain meeting

### RAM insights
* Stakeholder mapping isn't meant to be a single source of truth - it is a tool to capture a team's understanding of the stakeholder landscape, clarify stakeholder relationships, and surface stakeholder groups that may share common characteristics or challenges. Whilst this resource may not provide specific solutions to successful stakeholder engagement, a well thought-out, detailed stakeholder map will help facilitate bringing a team onto the same page, which can help progress developing stakeholder engagement pipelines.
* We encourage teams to define their own metrics for mapping stakeholders on a matrix for prioritisation. These metrics should be carefully chosen to represent the key stakeholder considerations and project team goals. For example, the team may try to:
    * Establish a community of practice for project governance
    * Prioritise communication methods and cadence for different stakeholder groups
    * Identify which groups may be negatively impacted by a research output
    * Identify which stakeholders are most prepared to adopt a particular research output
  Choosing the right metrics will help crystallise which are the crucial stakeholders to engage.
    
## Requirements gathering & alignment
### Key question: How can we align stakeholders on shared language and goals?

Requirements gathering is a helpful exercise used to collect information from different stakeholders involved in a project which can then be used to mitigate potential misunderstanding, map shared terminology, and identify opportunities for collaboration. 
When bringing people from different backgrounds or organisations into a collaboration, it can be helpful to align on shared language and understanding on key concepts relevant to a project.
This is motivated by the fact that different teams may have different ways of working and understandings of project outputs like "case study" or "user-friendly website" which can lead to miscommunication or misalignment of expectations.
Once the information is gathered in a single place, you can identify key questions and highlights from the interviews to prompt group discussion for alignment.

### Example resources
- Turing RAM team [requirements gathering questionnaire example](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-application-management/blob/main/docs/requirements_gathering.md) for understanding different team approaches to creating case studies

### RAM insights
* Often times different people will use the same term to mean completely different things or for different purposes
* This exercise can help detangle the nuances of a commonly used term and whether or not there is overlap, and thus provides an opportunity to build shared understanding and goals
* Requirements gathering is informed by the user interview process from the design and qualitative research worlds
* The work begins after you gather requirements information, which is the starting point to facilitate a group conversation

## Team strategy workshops
### Key question: How can we bring different ideas across the team into a shared team strategy?

A team will struggle to collaborate and progress together if its members are not aligned on what it is trying to achieve. 
Strategy alignment goes deeper than agreeing on day to day work - it asks what the team chooses to prioritise, what they value, what motivates them, and ultimately what real-world impact they hope to see from their work.
A helpful model to inform this exercise is Simon Sinek's [Golden Circle method](https://www.smartinsights.com/digital-marketing-strategy/online-value-proposition/start-with-why-creating-a-value-proposition-with-the-golden-circle-model/), where the team approaches their work in the following order:
* Why: Why are we doing what we're doing? 
    * This is the ultimate 'North Star' or 'vision' of the project - the fundamental, emotive reason the work is being done
* How: How do we achieve our mission? 
    * This question concerns the broad focus areas, or 'pillars' that setup up the project to achieve the vision
* What: What do we actually do?
    * This question takes the why and the how, and identifies key activities that teams can undertake to achieve their goals

It is important to take these conversations in order, so that team strategy and alignment can build from the bottom-up.

### Example resources
- [Further RAM Guidance](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-application-management/blob/main/docs/team_strategy.md) on facilitating Why/How/What team conversations

### RAM insights
* Using this basic infrastructure for the conversation helps provide focus and clarity and can lead to a better conversation
* By not overstructuring the conversation, you will also allow people the space to express their thoughts freely. We feel this is an important approach as it allows open conversations to happen and things to emerge that otherwise might not
* Strong facilitation skills are crucial, including reading the room and identifying patterns in the conversation. For more on  effective facilitation, check out:

## Stakeholder engagement categories and pipelines
### Key question: How do you effectively identify and implement methods for engaging with diverse stakeholders?
Once you have mapped your stakeholders, you may find there are diverse groups of key stakeholders to engage, with different needs, aims and preferred methods of communication.
For stakeholder engagement plans to be effective (that is, to have engaged stakeholders brought into the project), the methods of communication and engagement must be best suited to them.
To explore this topic, you can utilise the concept of user personas. Add some shit about this idea
(Sorry will come back to all this stuff)
* However, nothing is better than _talking to a representative group of each stakeholder type_. A great way to find out the needs of your stakeholder group is to run a kick-off, introductory workshop for this group! In this workshop you can cover things like:
    * What your project and work is about
    * Why this group of stakeholders is crucial
    * How you want this group of stakeholders to be involved
    * How to address one or two key questions for this group (to get them engaged and see why their involvement is important, and to get them participating as early as possible)
    * The best methods of including these stakeholders going forwards
* The more diverse your stakeholder groups, the more varied your engagement may need to become. Some may want a cadenced newsletter (e.g. fortnightly), others Collaboration Cafes or similar collaborative spaces, others asynchronous feedback via forms or surveys, others direct 1-1 interviews, or something else. Identifying your key stakeholders, how much capacity you have to accommodate their needs (ideally as much as they require), and how to structure your engagement for different groups is key.
* Having an active, monitored engagement pipeline is crucial. Keeping a record of who you communicated with, how (email, call, workshop, interview etc.), when, what was covered, and next steps, helps you stay on top of your stakeholder contacts. You can also use this space to explore what methods work and don't work. For instance, if you send 5 emails to a certain stakeholder group over a month and get no replies, you might need to try a different method of engagement.
* Follow ups work wonders! As a rule of thumb, following up at weekly cadences up to 3 times can really push engagement. There are different approaches you can give for each follow up. One approach is:
    * Initial email
    * Follow up (1 week) asking for thoughts
    * Follow up 2 (1 week) - specifically highlight why this stakeholder's engagement is crucial
    * Follow up 3 (1 week) - highlight this will be the last follow up and last chance to engage
* It is much more effective to reach out to individuals than groups - having a personalised email will highlight to people how they specifically are important to the project. Utilising mail merge can be a great time saver, whilst still maintaining the beauty of individual outreach and communication.

## User-centric design
### Key question: How can research outputs benefit from a user-centric design process?

Although many research tools are created for a very narrow purpose, we encourage researchers to consider the user experience (UX) throughout the process and to incorporate UX design principles to make the tool more accesible and usable for all potential users. 
Activities such as user journey mapping and user testing can greatly enhance your understanding of who is using the research tool and how they employ the tool in a real-world scenario.
By considering potential users of the tool from the early stages of a project, you can include features that will make the tool more accessible to potential stakeholders and therefore more likely to be used and applied in practice. 

Existing resources can also benefit greatly from making improvements to the UX by establishing heuristics to define criteria for usability and to identify areas in need of improvement.
By utilising exercises and heuristics designed specifically to consider and evaluate the user experience, researchers will examine the assumptions built into the tool and gain a deeper understanding of how it can serve different users types.
These insights can help a team to develop a roadmap for the tool to plan out future developments with varied stakeholders in mind, leading to more meaningful stakeholder engagements based around a deeper understanding of how those stakeholders are interacting with and repurposing your research output.
