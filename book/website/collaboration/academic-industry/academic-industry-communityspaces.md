## Setting up Community Spaces and Activities (in an Academic-Industry Collaboration??)

This subchapter gives an non-exhaustive list of tools and activities that you can establish in an Academic-Industry Collaboration to build community.

**Events:** Having joint events as a collaboration can be a great way of showcasing research and different perspectives from both organisations and creating a sense of joint ownership. 
This can be in many forms such as a seminar series, journal club or, as your collaboration progresses, a joint conference or symposium.

The Turing-Roche Partnership has an online [Knowledge Share Series](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/turing-roche-knowledge-share-series). 
Run by the Community Manager, this event series occurs monthly and each time tackles a different data science topic relevant to the partnership's aims. 
The event has a Turing speaker and a Roche speaker giving a presentation for 15 minutes each on the selected topic before a 20 minute Q&A session which generates good audience engagement.

**Slack Workspace:** As mentioned in the previous chapter, it is useful to have a shared space for the community to connect. 
The Turing-Roche partnership have utilised Slack for this purpose as they found it easy to set up, it works for asynchronous communication and you can add in apps such as organising random coffee chats.

**Newsletter:** A newsletter for your collaboration can be a useful way of sharing collaboration news, advertising your events and opportunities and spreading awareness. 
There is more info on how to create a newsletter in {ref}`this Turing Way chapter <ch-newsletters>`and you can also find previous Turing-Roche newsletters [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/turing-roche-partnership/tree/main/communications/newsletters).

**Collaboration Cafe/Co-working:** Collaboration Cafes and/or co-working sessions can help bring a sense of community to your collaboration. 
They can be spaces where you onboard new members, brainstorm or work on research together. 
More in this {ref}`this Turing Way chapter <ch-coworking>`.

**YouTube Channel:** Creating video content is a great way of getting your community involved in something creative.
The Turing-Roche Partnership has a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtDFLOFg1QBVfPUl5Ei9-Mg) where previous event recordings are uploaded, alongside other content such as a 'demystfying' video series- 5 minute videos demystifying a concept relevant to the partnership's research and a 'versus' video series where someone from Turing and someone from Roche debate data science topics from their perspective. 
You may need to consider branding requirements of each organisation before setting something like this up.

**GitHub Repository:** A GitHub Repository allows you to make project documentation and code open and invite members to collaborate on this. 
More info in this {ref}`the Getting Started with GitHub chapter <cl-github-novice>`. 

**Early Career Researcher or Fellows Scheme:** Many organisations, such as the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/programmes-and-events/fellowship-programme), [ELIXIR](https://fairplus-project.eu/) and the [Turing Institute ](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment) have developed programmes that allow external researchers to develop skills or projects and become part of that organisation's community. 
Often these type of schemes focus on early career researchers, allowing them to develop skills that can benefit their future careers. 
This type of scheme may work well for an academic-industry collaboration as it gives participants experience of two organisations and further bolsters your collaboration's community. 

The Turing-Roche partnership are currently developing a scheme which will embed PhD students within the partnership and allow them to attend a relevant conference and undertake a selected, community-based project.
