# Participating in Hybrid Events

- Online is bit rigid
- Following an online schedule for in-person is not practical. consider deviating from the schedule and check in at set points to allow for connecting but also not have a super rigid structure that doesn't work in person.
> [name=Patricia Herterich] I think this is heavily dependent on the type of event. For talks, I don't see why both cannot follow the same structure. For in-depth collaboration and unconference type discussions, there might be different dynamics.

- If there is a person in front of you, you need to focus on the person (not be rude), also focus on the online people (not be rude to them either) -- which is challenging to manage simultaneously
