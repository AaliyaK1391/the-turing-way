# Challenges faced during Hybrid Collaboration

- Online is bit rigid
- Following an online schedule for in-person is not practical. consider deviating from the schedule and check in at set points to allow for connecting but also not have a super rigid structure that doesn't work in person.
> [name=Patricia Herterich] I think this is heavily dependent on the type of event. For talks, I don't see why both cannot follow the same structure. For in-depth collaboration and unconference type discussions, there might be different dynamics.

- If there is a person in front of you, you need to focus on the person (not be rude), also focus on the online people (not be rude to them either) -- which is challenging to manage simultaneously

### Communication tools used for hybrid work environments
The variety of communication tools used in remote and hybrid work presents challenges for inclusiveness and involves asynchronous communication. Different tools serve various purposes, such as messaging, video chat, collaborative software development, and traditional methods like email and telephone. Adapting to new tools and norms is necessary when switching jobs. Poorly organised hybrid events can isolate online participants, and incorporating physical tools into online streaming is complex. Hybrid meetings require different etiquette, and unequal access to communication tools may exclude early career stage academics.
