When you do this, great things may happen:

- If your repository is hosted on GitHub, they will show the citation information in the sidebar, which makes it easy for visitors to cite your software or dataset correctly.
- When you publish your software on Zenodo via the GitHub-Zenodo integration, they will use the metadata from your CITATION.cff file.
- People can import the correct reference to your software into the Zotero reference manager via a browser plugin.
