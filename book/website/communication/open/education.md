## Open Educational Resources

Open educational resources (OERs) [{term}`def<Open Educational Resources>`] are teaching and learning materials that can be freely used and reused for learning or teaching at no cost, and without needing to ask permission. Examples are courses, including Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs), lectures, teaching materials, assignments, and various other resources. OERs are available in many different formats compatible with online usage, most obviously text, images, audio, and video. Anyone with internet access can access and use OERs; access is not dependent on location or membership of a particular institution.

Unlike copyrighted resources, OERs have been authored or created by an individual or organization that chooses to retain few, if any, ownership rights. In some cases, that means anyone can download a resource and share it with colleagues and students. In other cases, this may go further and enable people to edit resources and then re-post them as a remixed work. How do you know your options? OERs often have a Creative Commons licence or other permission to let you know how the material may be used, reused, adapted, and shared.

Fully open OERs comply with the 5 Rs:

- _Retain_: the right to make, own, and control copies of the content.
- _Reuse_: the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (for example, in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video).
- _Revise_: the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (for example, translate the content into another language).
- _Remix_: the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (for example, incorporate the content into a mashup).
- _Redistribute_: the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (for example, give a copy of the content to a friend).

Researchers generate a great deal of educational resources in the course of teaching students and each other (at workshops, for example).
By making these openly available (for example, in the [open educational resource commons](https://www.oercommons.org/)), the wider community can benefit from them in three main ways:

1. Most obviously, the community can use the materials to learn about the content they cover.
2. Sharing resources reduces duplication of effort.
If an educator needs materials for teaching and such materials already exist openly, then they need not make their own from scratch, thereby saving time.
3. Making materials openly available helps a community build better resources by improving those that already exist.
The community can combine several OERs to take advantage of their different strengths, such as a great diagram or explanation.

Beyond the raw practical benefits, the worldwide OER movement is rooted in the human right to access high-quality education.
This shift in educational practice is about participation and co-creation.
Open Educational Resources (OERs) offer opportunities for systemic change in teaching and learning content by involving educators in new participatory processes and leveraging effective technologies for learning engagement.
