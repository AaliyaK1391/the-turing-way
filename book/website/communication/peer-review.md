## Motivation and Background
Peer review is a collaborative effort to improve the quality of the research. 
In the traditional publishing model, there was a lot of focus on the peer review process of a journal article.
However, as the publishing models are changing, it is necessary to pay attention to other types of peer review.
We want to hightlight that peer review happens on different levels throughout a project, and is an ultimate form of engaging with other people's work.

## The artwork 

Alt text: The reviewer wolf really wants to be friends with the pigs, but the pigs perceive the wolf as a threat.
The pigs work amongst themselves (with their coauthors, colleagues, and office-mates) to improve their defenses against the world.
However, it is not until the pigs open their work to input from the entire community (including the wolf!) that they can build sturdy house.
Ultimately, the wolf and pigs work together to build a sturdy house that protects them all from the storm.
