# Research Object to capture the Research Life Cycle

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level
No previous knowledge is needed.

## Summary
Research outcomes encompass publications, data, software, bibliographical material and any other resources (such as experimental workflows, standards) that can be potentially useful for conducting research.

Research Objects (ROs) allow working open by design and share during the research process and not only the research outputs at the end.

In this chapter, we will describe the definition of ROs, their typologies and which platform and technologies exist.

## Background & Motivation
Research objects (ROs) are living resources helping to organise and describe the inputs, materials, and methods in open science and not only at the end when publishing the research outcomes. In short, ROs can be seen as a single information unit where any research material can be shared with other scientists at discrete milestones of the investigation identified by an PID, possibly a DOI. 

The entire research lifecycle can be captured, allowing the release and publication of results progressively, keeping track of versioning and change information. ROs facilitate reproducibility and reuse of the scientific methods and results through access to resources, context and metadata, and the possibility of forking existing ROs. As a result, ROs support evidence and support validation of findings claimed in scholarly articles.

ROs and their content have rich machine-readable metadata that can be complemented by automatically discovered metadata through text enrichment service, to enhance the findability and accessibility of all scientific work. 

All the research work, including potential failures, dead ends or any other information such as experimental protocols, standards as well as all the individuals who contributed to the research can be recorded in the RO.
