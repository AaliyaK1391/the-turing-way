# Research Object to capture the Research Life Cycle

## Prerequisites / recommended skill level
No previous knowledge is needed.
## Summary

Research outcomes encompass publications, data, software, bibliographical material and any other resources (such as experimental protocols, standards) that can be potentially useful for conducting the research. 

Research Objects allow to work open by design and share during the research process and not only the research outputs at the end.

A Research Object can be implemented as a "Research Object Crate" that is a **machine readable "bundle"** of all research artefacts as a whole.

## Background & Motivation

The main motivations are:
- to organize and describe the resources, materials, and methods of the research while conducting the research and not only at the end when publishing the outcomes of the research;
- to manage the entire research lifecycle, and allow the release and publication of results progressively, keeping track of versioning and change information;
- to share your research materials with other scientists at discrete milestones of your investigation, and collaborate via a single information unit uniquely identified by an PID, possible a DOI;
- to enhance the findability and accessibility of all the scientific outcomes through a single information unit associated with rich, machine-readable metadata;
- to facilitate reproducibility and reuse of the scientific methods and results via access to resources, context and metadata, and the possibility of forking existing results;
- to be recognized and cited (even of constituent parts) encouraging a faster release and publication of research materials;
- to preserve results and prevent decay using provenance for partial rerun;
- to provide evidence and support validation of findings claimed in scholarly articles;
- to acknowledge all the research work and all the individuals who contributed to the research, including potential failures, dead ends or any other information that is usually not captured;
