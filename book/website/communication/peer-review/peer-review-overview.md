# Peer Review Types

## Types of Peer Review
​
Peer review is a critical component of advancing research. Types of peer review include:
* manuscripts
* software (including code, documentation, and examples)
* communication and presentation materials

## Levels of Peer Review
* *Step 1* - Peer review often happens informally among team members.
Feedback helps improve your project, on its way to being shared with the broader community.​
* *Step 2* - The project is going well, but it needs input from the broader community to reach it's full potential.
This stage is often where the formal peer review process happens, but in an open project this level of feedback is often provided throughout.​
* *Step 3* - By incorporating everyone's ideas, the project unites the community and percieves feedback as a way to improve projects rather than as a competitive process.

We see peer review as an important exercise in [collaboration](We need to add links to collaboration here) not limited to a quality-safeguard procedure.
However, in current research practice, peer review often appears as a hurdle everyone needs to pass through.


For manuscripts, one of the added values of a journal articles, compared to, for instance, a preprint is that it has been [peer reviewed and modified by the author in response to the reviewer's suggestions](here we need to ling to guidlines).
