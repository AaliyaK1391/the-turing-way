What is Open Peer Review?

## Different types of Open Peer Review

There are various [models of Open Peer review](https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/) (see Ross-Hellauer et al. 2017 for more details):

- publishing peer review content
- open discussion between authors, editors and reviewers
- open review before publication through preprints, allowing for open review from a wider community
- post-publication commenting
- sharing author or reviewer identities
- decoupling the peer review process from the publication process (eLife)


Nevertheless, not everyone is comfortable signing their reviews - particularly people from minoritized groups in research (Fox 2021). 
This could result in less critical reviews if revealing identity is a requirement of Peer Review (Fox 2021). 

## Benefits of Open Peer Review

- including increasing accountability of reviewers, which should in turn increase the quality, fairness, constructiveness and courteousness of reviews ([4-9]
- Transparency allows for validation of peer review and [identifying biases](https://twitter.com/giladfeldman/status/1568391773353037824)
- Recogntion for Peer Review (especially if it can become a Research Object)
- Reviews can become reusable (as normally the authors of review retain copyright and if they are anonymous you cannot ask their permission)
- Reviews can be used as teaching materials to improve the peer review process

The ability of double-anonymized review to address biases in peer review remains questionable, as was noted in other responses to Huber et al. (8). But worse, essentially double-anonymized peer review tries to minimize the consequences of these biases without addressing their causes. Horbach et al. 2022

Double-anonymous peer review may impede open science practices in several ways (Horbach et al. 2022): 
1. Preprinting
2. Preprint peer review
3. Review curation
4. Micro-publications
5.
