What is Open Peer Review?

## Different types of Open Peer Review

There are various [models of Open Peer review](https://plos.org/resource/open-peer-review/) (see {cite:ps}`RossHellauer2017openreview` for more details):

- Open Content
  - publishing peer review content
- Open Participation
  - open review before publication through preprints
- Open Identities
  - open discussion between authors, editors and reviewers

- open review before publication through preprints, allowing for open review from a wider community
- post-publication commenting
- sharing author or reviewer identities
- decoupling the peer review process from the publication process (eLife)

Similar to open science practices in general - open peer review is not an 'all or nothing' concept. 
Instead, the open components that make the most sense can be introduced first.
One of the more debated parts of Open Peer Review is whether reviews should be signed {cite:ps}`RossHellauer2017openreview` {cite:ps}`Bravo2019openreview`.
Nevertheless, not everyone is comfortable signing their reviews - particularly people from minoritized groups in research {cite:ps}`Fox2021openreview`. 
This could result in less critical reviews if revealing identity is a requirement of Peer Review {cite:ps}`Fox2021openreview`. 

## Benefits of Open Peer Review

- including increasing accountability of reviewers, which should in turn increase the quality, fairness, constructiveness and courteousness of reviews ([4-9]
- Transparency allows for validation of peer review and [identifying biases](https://twitter.com/giladfeldman/status/1568391773353037824)
- Recogntion for Peer Review (especially if it can become a Research Object)
- Reviews can become reusable (as normally the authors of review retain copyright and if they are anonymous you cannot ask their permission)
- Reviews can be used as teaching materials to improve the peer review process
- [Facilitates dialogue](https://polarjournal.org/2022/06/13/__trashed-2/) and [collaboration](https://allegralaboratory.net/who-cares-peer-review-at-allegra/) between authors, reviewers and editors 

"[Anonymity allows for abuse, which editors do not always moderate successfully](https://polarjournal.org/2022/06/13/dispirited-away-the-peer-review-process/)." - Dada Docot

The ability of double-anonymized review to address biases in peer review remains questionable, as was noted in other responses to Huber et al. (8). But worse, essentially double-anonymized peer review tries to minimize the consequences of these biases without addressing their causes {cite:ps}`Horbach2022openreview`

**Double-anonymous peer review** may impede open science practices in several ways {cite:ps}`Horbach2022openreview`: 
1. Preprinting
2. Preprint peer review
3. Review curation
4. Micro-publications
5.
