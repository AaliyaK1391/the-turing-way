## Summary
This chapter describes the new types of articles born out of the growth of open research and the expansion in publishing all aspects of the research lifecycle. Each subchapter gives an overview of an article type.

Chapters included are:

* Data papers 
* Methods papers
* Micropublishing
* Software papers
* Registered reports


(cm-dif-articles-motivation)=
## Motivation and Background
Traditionally journal publications have been in the format of stand alone research articles, often with a format of abstract, introduction, methods, results and discussion sections.

This format was often quite limiting and meant things like datasets, software (scripts, code, apps, tools) and methods were often squeezed into research articles with little detail due to word limits, or hidden in supplementary material or not included at all. 

This has led to the development of new article types, which allows all research outputs produced during the research lifecycle to be published in their own right and linked to the final interpretations and conclusions of a research project. 
The linking of these articles is one way to fully publish a reproducible research project. 

Having separate article types for these outputs allows the people involved (such as research software engineers, data stewards) to receive sufficient credit and impact for their work, particularly as publications are still the main currency by which researchers are evaluated.

Theses articles are also important for the sustainability, reproducibility and openness of these research outputs as writing detailed publications means greater care and attention is directed at describing and explaining these outputs and in turn makes these outputs more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable).

Note: in this chapter and subchapter we are using the phrase article and paper interchangeably.
