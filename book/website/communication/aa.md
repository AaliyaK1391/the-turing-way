## Motivation and Background
The academic landscape is rapidly changing in favour of research projects involving large collaborations and interdisciplinary teams. 
This makes decisions concerning academic authorship hard to navigate and especially the need to consider different contributions fairly. 
Consequently, there is a shift in how researchers are thinking about assigning authors to research outputs and what types of contributions are valued.
