# Recommendations and Resources

## Checklist for Setting your Project

* Create README and Vision file
* Create a project roadmap to share
* Develop a CONTRIBUTING file
* Select & adopt a Code of Conduct with reporting & enforcement guide
* You can also create a page dedicated to help your community members explore your project and its resources (see [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/)).

These documents are also effective tools for community building as it supports early contributors to get easily onboarded and makes it easy for past contributors to return.

## GitHub Insights

GitHub encourages collaboration practice in their community guidelines.
The insights tab of your GitHub project provides a section called "Community" that includes a list of recommended documents that your project should have.
