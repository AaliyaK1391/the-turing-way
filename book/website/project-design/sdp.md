## Summary

In this chapter, we describe tools and practices that can help you work reproducibly, even when your project deals with sensitive data. 
We describe steps that are good to think about already at the start of your project, such as how to {ref}`ensure that your sensitive files remain secure<pd-sdp-sensitive-files>` when using GitHub. 
We also show how you can {ref}`safely share your code<pd-sdp-sensitive-code>`, even though it uses sensitive data, and draw attention to {ref}`what you should do if you inadvertently expose sensitive data on GitHub<pd-sdp-exposing-data>`.

## Motivation

Researchers who are part of sensitive data projects may think that the nature of their data prohibits them from working in an open and reproducible manner. 
  We want to show that - while it may require a bit of extra thinking and management - working openly with sensitive data (whilst keeping the data secure), is possible, and should be encouraged.
