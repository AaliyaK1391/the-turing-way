## Communication

The project members can be reached on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-fn608gvb-h_ZSpoA29cCdUwR~TIqpBw).

In addition, you can reach _The Turing Way_ email (currently managed by Malvika Sharan): theturingway@gmail.com. 

You can reach the PI and Co-I of the project through their preferred way of communication:
- Kirstie Whitaker: Mention me on a Github issue or pull request ([@KirstieJane](https://github.com/KirstieJane)), or tag me in Slack, `@KirstieJane`.
  
- Malvika Sharan: Not full time on the project until mid-January 2020, but available by email 1 day per week at [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk)

You can reach out to all members on Slack or by tagging them on GitHub issues or Pull Request.

You can join members of the core team and the wider Turing Way community at our twice-monthly [Collaboration Cafes](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html), which are great places to discuss ideas for new contributions and to get started with making them. :rocket:

You can watch talks, presentations and recordings from different events on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDxZv5BMzAw0mPobCbMNuA).

## Project management

### Issues
- Once completed, issues should be closed immediately. By adding "closes #issue" or [something similar](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in a comment on a pull request, merging the pull request will close the issue automatically.
- The team members triage on open issues, review Pull Requests or address any questions raised on GitHub asynchrnously. As most team members do not work full time on the _Turing Way_, it might take some time until your query or contribution is addressed - especially if expert knowledge is needed.

Don't be afraid to nudge if I've not replied after a day or two! :sparkling_heart:

### Pull requests
- Pull requests should be reviewed in a timely manner.
- When reviewing a pull request, please do not use the "request a change" function but comment on the change or make a pull request to the file that should be merged.

## Commitments
All The Turing Way team members commit to
- making the implicit explicit by documenting their work
- abiding by the Code of Conduct in all community platform and spaces where they represent _The Turing Way_
- following thw contribution guideline and keep it up to date
- dedicating time to update contribution guidelines and other core documents needed to facilitate collaboration
- feed back on issues in open source software used throughout _The Turing Way_ by opening an issue in those open source packages and trying to fix them (including documentation)
- Document and share any conversation from closed spaces (such as email, Slack or 1:1 meeting) in a GitHub issue that could be useful for the community or community members in enabling their work in _The Turing Way_
