## Commitments
All The Turing Way team members commit to
- making the implicit explicit by documenting their work
- abiding by the Code of Conduct in all community platforms and spaces where they represent _The Turing Way_
- following the contribution guideline and keeping it up to date
- dedicating time to update contribution guidelines and other core documents needed to facilitate collaboration
- feedback on issues in open source software used throughout _The Turing Way_ by opening an issue _The Turing Way_ GitHub repo or other open source projects where this issue can be fixed
- Contribute their time and expertise in fixing open issues either directly via GitHub or provide mentorship and support to community members and project contributors
- Record any new updates, exceptions or useful knowledge in a project management document
- Document and share any conversation from closed spaces (such as email, Slack or 1:1 meeting) in a GitHub issue that could be useful for the community or community members in enabling their work in _The Turing Way_ 

## Communication

The project members can be reached on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-fn608gvb-h_ZSpoA29cCdUwR~TIqpBw).

You can reach the PI and Co-I of the project through their preferred way of communication:
- You can mention Malvika Sharan (@malvikasharan) and Kirstie Whitaker (@KirstieJane) on a Github issue or pull request, or tag in Slack.

In addition, you can reach _The Turing Way_ email (currently managed by Malvika Sharan): theturingway@gmail.com. 
You can also contact Malvika by emailing [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk).

You can reach out to all members on Slack or by tagging them on GitHub issues or Pull Requests.

You can join members of the core team and the wider Turing Way community at our twice-monthly [Collaboration Cafes](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html), which are great places to discuss ideas for new contributions and to get started with making them. :rocket:

You can watch talks, presentations and recordings from different events on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPDxZv5BMzAw0mPobCbMNuA).

## Project management

### Issues
- Once completed, issues should be closed immediately. By adding "closes #issue" or [something similar](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in a comment on a pull request, merging the pull request will close the issue automatically.
- The team members triage on open issues, review Pull Requests or address any questions raised on GitHub asynchronously. As most team members do not work full time on the _Turing Way_, it might take some time until your query or contribution is addressed - especially if expert knowledge is needed.

Don't be afraid to nudge if they've not replied after a few days! :sparkling_heart:

### Pull requests
- Pull requests should be reviewed on time. If we are unable to review due to specific technical requirements or lack of time (or any reason), please assign a reviewer to the Pull Request for review.
- Whenever possible, post about the issues and Pull Requests in public forums (newsletter, Slack, twitter) to facilitate participation from new members in the community
- When reviewing a pull request, please do not use the "request a change" function but comment on the change or make a pull request to the file that should be merged.
